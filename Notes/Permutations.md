- Permutations  
the problem can be abstracted as self-increase of a number.  
    - e.p.:  
all possible character is "1234567890"  
length is five  
so you just need define an int array(length five)  
[0,0,0,0,0] stand "11111"  
[0,0,0,0,1] stand "11112"  
[0,0,0,0,2] stand "11113"  
......  
[9,9,9,9,7] stand "00008"  
[9,9,9,9,8] stand "00009"  
[9,9,9,9,9] stand "00000"  

  - just like self-increase of a number.  
A little bit different.
